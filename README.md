# Yharnam

ðŸŒ˜ [WIP] This is a Nextjs v9.5.4 starter project with Prismic & Shopify (enabled via Prismic integration fields). 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## DEPLOY

This project is set up specifically to run on Netlify, so you need netlify cli tools

`npm i netlify-cli --g`

Set up your netlify environment variables (`.env.local` for development):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRISMIC_ACCESS_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRISMIC_REPO=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_NAME=
```

## TODO
